# Spring_Experiment

The main page is in html/index.html<br/>
This page uses hichart.js to show the experiment data and use selectToUISlider.js to beautify pop windows.<br/>
I design a js function let spring and weight can drag to the middle area and display animation.<br/>

At first, you must fill in the right column, and you can drag the  drag to the middle area to see the animation.
Then, you should fill the right column use number and you can see the chart.
